# numerical-PDE-experiments
A collection of Python code and Google Colab notebooks that implement classic numerical PDE algorithms (Finite Differences, Finite Elements, Multigrid) and analyze performance. You can open the Google Colab notebooks (.ipynb) through GitHub to view the code and correpsonding plots and analysis!
